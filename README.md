# CyberThreatDAO

## Introduction

This project implements a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) focused on providing transparent, secure, and efficient cyber insurance through Ethereum smart contracts. The DAO leverages blockchain technology, an ERC-20 governance token, automated premium adjustments, on-chain analytics, and Chainlink oracle integration for external cybersecurity incident verification.

## Motivation

Traditional insurance processes often lack transparency, efficiency, and responsiveness, especially concerning cybersecurity threats. This project addresses these challenges by harnessing blockchain's decentralized and immutable nature, promoting transparent decision-making, real-time risk management, and community-driven governance.

## Project Structure

This repository contains two primary Solidity smart contracts:

- `CyberToken.sol`: ERC-20 token used for staking and governance.
- `CyberInsuranceDAO.sol`: Core DAO contract managing claims, voting, staking, automated premium adjustments, on-chain analytics, and oracle integration.

## Understanding and Concept

The DAO operates through:

- **Claim Management**: Members submit claims that are voted upon by token-holding members.
- **Governance via ERC-20 Tokens**: Voting power is determined by the amount of CyberTokens staked by members.
- **Automated Premium Adjustments**: Premium rates are dynamically adjusted based on claim outcomes.
- **On-chain Analytics**: DAO performance metrics such as total claims, approved/rejected/disputed claims, voting statistics, and liquidity health are tracked transparently.
- **Oracle Integration**: Optional Chainlink oracle integration enables external cybersecurity incident verification, enhancing decision accuracy.

## Deployment Steps

### Requirements

- Ethereum Wallet (e.g., MetaMask)
- Solidity development environment (e.g., Remix IDE, Hardhat)
- Chainlink oracle setup (optional)

### Deployment Process

1. **Deploy ERC-20 Token Contract** (`CyberToken.sol`):
   - Deploy using Remix or Hardhat.
   - Mint initial supply to your wallet.

2. **Deploy DAO Contract** (`CyberInsuranceDAO.sol`):
   - Provide the deployed token contract address during deployment.
   - Set Chainlink oracle parameters if applicable.

3. **Verification on Etherscan**:
   - Verify your contracts to enhance transparency.

### Interaction

- Deposit tokens for voting and governance.
- Submit and vote on claims.
- Observe premium rate adjustments and analytics through provided functions.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a practical application of blockchain technology and decentralized governance to revolutionize cyber insurance. The DAO model ensures transparency, community-driven decision-making, and operational efficiency, laying a robust foundation for future decentralized financial services.
